# BASM - BI Assembly Language



## "Ah, ok... I see... And... What IS this here?"

At the start of this project, BASM was made for working with TBI3 (Triploit Binary Interpreter - BI(nary) Assembly Language). 
Actually, it should be an interpreted programming language, but it will translate to C++.


BASM is a small pseudo-assembler and doesn't have many bugs, so I think. If you find one, please create an Issue!  
That's it so far, a documentation will follow later.
